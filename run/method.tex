All the following work is based on the measurement of gamma rays coming from the intra- and extra-galactic sources. The quality and accuracy of the data is one of the most important point that will determine the general quality of the results. Thus it is capital to be certain that the gathering and treatment was done properly.

The Fermi collaboration Large Area Telescope (LAT) observed the gamma-ray sky since 2008 and provides all the data of this work.
All the information and data are available on the web and anybody can access them, using the tools given by Fermi.

Since the observation is still on-going it is important to stay up-to-date. The treatment method is also being improved regularly, improving every time the statistics, the systematic errors and the point source subtraction.
One of the most important step in the treatment process is the first one, the selection of the events. Every photon measured is saved along with all its properties in a big data file. Then this long list is filtered to keep only the interesting observations. The filter can be based on the incoming direction, the energy or the time of observation, but also on the quality of the event reconstruction. This last cut can be critical. It will determine the chances that the measured event is in fact a gamma ray, and not some background noise polluting the data. Of course, the more strict the filter is, the less events are kept for analysis and the statistical errors can become large. This work uses the CLEAN class recommended by the Fermi team for diffuse emission analysis.

The main parameters of the selection can be found in Tab \ref{tab:fermi_selection_parameters}.

An other important point is the creation of the exposure map. It basically tells how long the telescope spend observing a given part of the sky. After dividing the count map by the exposure, a flux map is obtained that does not depends on the observation time of particular regions. 
%For example, if the telescope observed the galactic center ten times more often than the Orion nebula , there is no way to know at first if the higher counts in the GC is due to the longer exposition time or a higher intensity.
%It is used to correct an observation bias. 

The goal of this work is to study the diffuse sources of gamma-rays from inside and outside the milky way. Of course, the LAT does not differentiate them from point sources gamma rays. This has to be done manually as the last step in the treatment process. A large catalog of gamma ray point sources (3FGL) is available on line on NASA website. This catalog lists most of the known and identified point sources, along with their spectral shape and flux. These informations can then be used, combined with the exposure map, to model the number of counts coming from point sources and their spatial and energetic distribution. Once this model map is obtained, it is subtracted from the data to only keep the diffuse emission. Since the models are never perfect and all point sources are not listed, errors or anomalies in the observations can appear. Keeping the dataset up-to-date allows to use the latest catalogs and avoid a lot of mistakes.

Once all the treatment is done, a flux map of the entire sky in $counts/s/m^2/GeV/sr$ is produced. The map is divided in bins of $0.5 \times 0.5$ degrees on a Cartesian projection. Every bin contains 30 logarithmic energy bins ranging from 60 MeV to 513 GeV with a 1.2 multiplicative step. The final data cube is thus of dimension $720 \times 360 \times 30$. For visibility purposes, every energy bin is multiplied by its energy squared, becoming an energy flux in $GeV/s/m^2/sr$. This will be the default units used for the rest of this work.

The errors on the data are coming from two sources. First are systematic errors introduced by the instrument or the treatment process.   They are pretty low, around 3\%, but can increase for low or high energies (Fig. \ref{fig:LAT_sys_err}). The second source is the statistical errors, proportional to the square root of counts. This property will make them decrease when the acquisition time will increase. They are dominant at high energy (above 50 GeV) where events are rare. On contrary at low energies (around 100 MeV), the systematic errors dominate. The final equation is the following :

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{tot} =\sqrt{\sigma_{sys}^2 + \sigma_{stat}^2} = \sqrt{\sigma_{sys}^2 + \frac{1}{N}}
\end{equation}

 \caption{Systematic error for Pass 8 data as function of the energy and the treatment quality. The energy dispersion is an effect of the uncertainty when measuring a photon's energy. Accounting for it when calculating the instrument response function can be critical at very low energies (around a few hundred MeV), where the statistical uncertainties are not dominant anymore.}

\subsubsection{$\pi^0$ production by propagated cosmic rays (PCR)}

%%% ARTICLE
The initial propagated proton spectrum for the PCR template is obtained from the observed proton data from AMS-02 %\todo{cite[55]}. 
A good approximation is an unbroken power law ($R-\alpha$) with a spectral index ($\alpha$) of 2.85 at rigidities above 45 GV. At lower rigidities the data are below the power law because of solar modulation %\todo{cite[56]}
, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:proton_spec}, where the AMS-02 data are plotted as well. To find the best parametrization, several indexes and breaks were tested. The optimal parametrization was found by interpolation between the fits with the best test statistic.
Finally, the gamma-ray data are well described by an unbroken power law for the protons with a spectral index ($\alpha$) of 2.85 at all rigidities.\\
%%% ARTICLE

%There is also the possibility to introduce a break around a few GeV, to have a slightly harder spectrum at lower energies.\\

The interstellar electron spectra needs a break around 0.2 GeV with a spectral index of 3.21 above. This  is compatible with the locally observed electron spectrum (see Fig. \ref{fig:electron_spec}). Below the break the optimal spectral index is 0.81, which implies a suppression of electrons. %The break point might be related to the fact that around 0.2 GeV electrons have the smallest energy losses, since above this energy synchrotron, BR and IC dominate the energy losses, while below this energy ionization losses become strong, thus depleting the electron spectrum below 1 GeV. A similar break in the electron spectrum was needed in the Fermi diffuse model \todo{cite[46]}.\\
The targets for the production of gamma-rays are the interstellar gas and the interstellar radiation field (IRF), which are both strongly dependent of position%The latter consists of photons from the cosmic microwave background, the infrared radiation from hot matter, like dust and the star light
, so the photon composition varies with sky direction.
For this reason, we have to calculate the IC templates for each sky direction. The variation over the sky is about $\pm 10\%$, as shown in \ref{fig:IC_variations}. 
The BR template only depends on the interstellar gas distribution, decreasing the variations considerably compared to IC, as shown in \ref{fig:BR_variations}.
%Note that the intensity of photons in the interstellar radiation field nor the gas density play any role in a template analysis, since the intensity of each contribution to the gamma-ray sky is determined by the fitted normalization factors in Eq. 1.



%The IC and BR spectra are both obtained from the interstallar electron distribution, taken here as a broken powerlaw with a break \todo{at 1GeV}. The index is 3.21 over the break and 0.8 below.
%The IRF is composed in the mostly by starlight (UV), and in with smaller contribution dust emission (IR) and the cosmic microwave background. The first two components of the IRF are position dependant, and this is why we have to calculate the IC spectrum for every sky direction.
%The BR component is directly linked to the gas, and charged particles distribution. This is also a reason too calculate the BR component in every sky directions. The variations are not too large.

\subsubsection{$\pi^0$ production by source cosmic rays (SCR)}

%%% ARTICLE
The proton spectra producing the SCR template can be described by an unbroken power law with a spectral index of 2.1, as obtained from the best gamma-ray template fit. The index 2.1 for the SCR template %agrees with the data from the Fermi Bubbles, shown by the data points inside the shaded band in Fig. \ref{fig:proton_spec}; the index 2.1 
is expected from diffuse shock wave acceleration. %\todo{cite[60, 61]} 
The source cosmic rays are accelerated, or do not have the time to decelerate, hence a harder spectrum at high energies.

%The fact that the Fermi Bubbles and the cosmic rays inside sources have the same spectrum strongly suggests that they are connected by point sources providing advective outflows of gas in the Galactic center. \todo{cite[44]}
%%% ARTICLE

\subsubsection{$\pi^0$ production by molecular clouds cosmic rays MCR)}

%%% ARTICLE
A proton spectrum with broken power-law can parametrized the decreasing gamma-ray emissivity from MCs below 2 GeV. The break can vary from 6 to 14 GeV for different clouds according to the fit. Above the break an optimal spectral index of 2.85 was found to be the same as for the PCR spectrum, as expected if the high energy propagated protons are above a certain magnetic cutoff. But below the break, , the optimal spectral index is 0.7, thus providing a significant suppression of protons below the break, as can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:proton_spec}.  %Energy losses alone cannot reproduce such a suppression of the proton spectrum below the break, but magnetic cutoffs are able to do so. Such a cutoff is well known from cosmic rays entering the Earth's magnetic field: particles below typically 20 GV entering near the magnetic equator do not reach the Earth, but are repelled into outer space by the geomagnetic cutoff. \todo{cite[62]} The rigidity cutoff of 20 GV is proportional to the magnetic moment. Although the magnetic field near the Earth (0.5 G) is orders of magnitude higher than the typical magnetic fields in dense MCs \todo{cite[63]}, the much larger sizes of MCs - or its substructure of filaments and cloudlets \todo{cite[64]} - yield magnetic moments of the same order of magnitude as the Earth's magnetic moment, so similar magnetic cutoffs are plausible. 
Variations in the magnetic cutoff in MCs are expected from the variations in size and in magnetic field; the latter increases with MC density. %\todo{cite[63]} 
The variations of the break in the proton spectrum between 6 and 14 GeV varies the maximum of the gamma-ray spectrum around a few GeV.
The fit prefers a constant spectral index below the break for all sky directions. Such a constant spectral index is plausible with regular magnetic fields oriented in the disk %\todo{cite[65, 66]} 
and the "cloudlets" inside MCs %\todo{cite[64]} 
form magnetic dipole fields. Then the largest cutoff occurs for cosmic rays entering from the halo perpendicular into the cloud for any orientation of the magnetic dipole. For a given entrance angle the cutoff would provide a sharp break, but for an isotropic distribution of entrance angles the break points are smeared. A distribution of break points will provide a slope below the maximum break determined largely by the isotropic distribution of the entrance angles into the disk. Since this distribution is the same for all MCs the slopes below the break will be similar for all MCs, even if the maximum break varies.
%%% ARTICLE

%
%The MCR component is produced by the same process than for PCR, but with a different proton distribution. Due to the magnetic cut-off in MCs, we introduce a break in the proton spectrum between 6 and 14GeV. We leave the index above to 2.85 as for PCR as expected, but we reduce it to 0.7.\\
%
%The magnetic fields around such clouds are not as strong than what we have in the solar system, but the spatial scales are much bigger and could produce such a break. Of course it position may vary from clouds to clouds and it is why we choose to free its position when fitting.\\
%
%This gives us a spectrum peaking around 2GeV.


\subsubsection{Dark matter annihilation (DM)}

%%% ARTICLE
Dark matter particles are expected to annihilate and produce hadrons of roughly twice the WIMP mass, just like in electron-positron annihilation. This should produce copious amounts of gamma-rays from $\pi^0$ decays. A smaller fraction of WIMP annihilation can lead to tau lepton pairs, which can lead to $\pi^0$ production in the hadronic tau decays. This contribution is expected to be small and is neglected. The DM template can be calculated with the DarkSusy software. %\todo{cite[67, 68]} 
An annihilation signal peaking around 2-3 GeV requires a WIMP mass around 50 GeV, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:norm_excess_component}. 
The DM template falls down to zero for energies above twice the WIMP mass, which differentiate it from the MCR spectrum with a much softer spectrum. 
%%% ARTICLE

%
%The DM spectrum is calculated using the DarkSUSY software. Since the initial WIMP mass is not known, we chose to let the fit decide in the CMZ region and fix it to this value in the other regions. The value generally turns around 50GeV, which make the gamma-ray spectrum peak around 2GeV.


\subsubsection{Milli-second pulsars gamma-ray production (MSP)}

The MSP template is directly taken from the Fermi study %\todo{cite paper}
. They simulated the emission of 1700 milli-second pulsars with different energies around the galactic center.
The high energy shape of the spectrum resemble closely the DM template, but the main difference with DM and MCR is for low energies. Indeed, below 1 GeV, the MSP template is a lot softer and this feature makes it discernible from the two others.

\subsubsection{Isotropic component}

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{pic/method/iso_calibration.png}
 \caption{The fitted data (abscissa) versus the observed data (ordinate) in every region of the sky for a given energy of 1 GeV. A linear fit is performed to find the offset at the vertical axis. This number represent the amount the isotropic component shifts the data in all cones. Once this is done for every energy bin, the offset is added to the previous isotropic template and the process is repeated until convergence.}
 \label{fig:iso_calibration}
\end{figure}


%%% ARTICLE
The isotropic template represents the contribution from the isotropic extragalactic background and hadron mis-identification. Its spectral shape and absolute normalization are provided within the Fermi software %\todo{cite[51]}
, but it was redetermined for the analysis as follow.
A first fit of the data in regions outside the Bubbles and the Galactic disk using the isotropic template from the Fermi software is produced as an initial estimate. If one plots the total observed gamma-ray flux versus the fitted flux in the various cones in a certain energy bin, one expects a linear relation crossing the origin if the isotropic flux is estimated correctly (See Fig. \ref{fig:iso_calibration}). 
However, if the isotropic contribution is either too low or too high, an offset at the origin is introduced in the linear relation. Since the isotropic component is by definition the same for all cones for a given energy, this offset can be subtracted from the Fermi template to improve the fit.
%An example of such a fit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:iso_calibration} for an energy bin between \todo{3.7-5.2 GeV}. 
Once the offset is determined for each energy bin and subtracted from the original template, the process is repeated until the offset converges to zero.
%The resulting template in our analysis has deviations from the Fermi template up to $35\%$ above 2 GeV, as shown in the insert of \ref{fig:iso_calibration}.

\section{Fitting method}
%My method:
%	-Spectral templates fitted to the data
%		-independant spatial cones on the entire sky (usually 797 for optimized sizes)
%		-minimum chi2 fit using ROOT for every cone
%		-Benefits
%			-energy related features
%			-only a few degrees of freedom -> Well constrained fit (5(or 6) dof against 21-30 points)
%		-Downside:
%			-No spatial templates. (only the isosky)


The fitted data can be seen as a data cube whose dimension are longitude, latitude and energy. The finest spatial grid is divided in $720 \times 360$ cones of $ 0.5^\circ \times 0.5^\circ $. Every cone contains 30 energy bins. This allows to treat different portions of the sky independently of one another. Since the cones do not have the same solid angle and the statistic in a small binning can be problematic, the grid is more often composed of 797 bins of different sizes, bigger at the poles and smaller near the equator. This allows a better statistic in lower flux regions and where a high spatial resolution is not needed (i.e. at high latitudes). In the same time, the equator and the GC have a lot more counts and can be treated in a smaller binning. This binning is way faster to compute than a regular grid with an good enough output quality to study the results.\\

The fit uses a certain number of components (three at least) each corresponding to a certain phenomenon and described earlier. They all have a certain energy spectra, that can vary with the position in the sky (for PCR, BR and IC). (See Fig. \ref{fig:norm_spectra)}

The fits are done for every bin independently. After choosing the templates used for the fit, their scaling factor is the only degree of freedom allowed. Using a ROOT TVirtualFitter object, every template is scaled up or down until their sum comes the closest to the data. 
Mathematically, the minimum distance between the model and the data is found when the $\chi^2$ value is lowest. It is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{30}[\frac{(D_i - \sum_{j=1}^{n}n_j.T_{ij})^2}{\sigma^2}]
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $D_i$ is the data flux in the $i^th$ energy bin.
\item $n_j$ is the scaling factor for the $j^th$ model component.
\item $T_{ij}$ is the model flux of the $j^th$ in the $i^th$ energy bin.
\item $\sigma_i$ is the geometric mean of the statistical and systematical error of the Fermi data point $i$.
\end{itemize}

The fit is very well constrained with only five or six degrees of freedoms depending on the model against 30 data points. A useful value is the $\chi^2 / d.o.f$ where $d.o.f = \#data\ points - \#degrees\ of\ freedom - 1$. This rescaling has the advantage to bring the perfect $\chi^2$ value down to one, thus making the comparison between different fits easier. This rescaling will be applied every time when speaking about $\chi^2$ in the rest of the discussion, except if explicitly told. 
The closest a $\chi^2$ value is to one, the better the model follows the data. The higher it gets, the lower the quality of the fit. It can also happen that it gets lower than one. This can happen when the fit is good, but the error bars on the data are too big.

Since every bin is fitted independently, it is not possible to implement a spatial template, i.e. where the spatial shape of a component would be fixed in advance. For example a component with a spherical distribution around the GC, as can be done in other works %\todo{cite}
. The hope is to let the fit find reasonable shapes by itself only using the $\chi ^2$ minimization technique.



%\section{Introduction of results}

This fitting method offers many ways to look at the results, depending on the interest. It is possible to produce flux maps of each component to study their spatial shapes at different enrgies. This can for example show a correlation between a certain template and a galaxy feature such as the disk or the bubbles. An other way is to create a spectrum of one cone to look at the relative quantity of every template at different energies. This can put into evidence problems in the models and help perfect the spectral shape of the components.

The first step when testing a new model is to see if it can reproduce results of previous studies. Only once it works and can be confidently used can it produce new results.

%The next chapter will describe these results, first reproducing old studies, and 

%Recreation of previous studies (GC excess, problems).\\
