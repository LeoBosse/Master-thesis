History of CR  and GR detection.
	-> 20th century to today
Why are they so important
	-> highest particle energy, we are not able to recreate that
	-> good understanding of their origin and evolution can inform on the sources, the galaxy, all that we havn't thought of yet (DM?)
GC excess in GR
	-> problem in our understanding of CR
	-> Something is missing : DM, MSP or MCs
Lets compare the 3 main hypothesis
	-> fitting the latest observations with current theory

Problem : Which of these hypothesis works better ?
	
Plan:
	-> theory
	-> method
	-> results and discussion


	
	

Conclusion

Resume what I did
	-> fit
	-> method

Results
	-> MCR is the fit winner
	-> DM and MSP also work, but do not follow their predictions

Opening
	-> Put limit on DM mass and cross-section
	-> Find other ways to study DM
