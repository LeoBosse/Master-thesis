\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {\relax 1.3}{\ignorespaces Cosmic ray spectrum as seen by several experiments. This characteristic shape can remind a leg, with a "knee" around $5.10^{15} eV$ and two different spectral indexes on both sides. Below $1^{10}$ eV, the spectrum flattens due to the solar and earth magnetic field which deflect lo energy particles. On the other side of the spectrum, above $1^{18}$ eV, the spectrum hardens imperceptibly, and the statistics are very low, but it is the highest energetic particles ever observed. In comparison, the red and blue arrows show two of the best human attempts to recreate very high energetic particles and give an idea how powerful CR can be.

The energy dispersion is the energy resolution of the instrument; this effect is known and can be corrected (in red), lowering the systematic errors. This is what was done for this study. The black line does not account for energy dispersion. The blue line shows the systematics for specific event types, a kind of analysis that does not make sense for this work. The few percent gained with the energy dispersion treatment at very low energies (below a few hundred MeV), where the statistical uncertainties are not dominant any more, can be critical.\relax }}{16}{figure.caption.8}

These bad $\chi ^2$ regions are the sign that one or two of the problems identified on the left are present. Several bad spots can also be identified. These correspond to a bad point source subtraction when processing the data (cf. chapter \ref {ch:method}) and should be ignored.\relax }}{24}{figure.caption.14}

The EGRET data were fitted by \cite {EGRET paper}, and their model take a PCR, BR, IC and dark matter templates. The maximum energy of the EGRET data is 10 GeV, and the model agrees relatively well at all energies. The model used on the Fermi data is as close as possible from the EGRET model, with the PCR, BR, IC and DM template of this study, but this time the data go up to 500 GeV. Once again, the model agrees for all energies below 10 GeV; but it can not account for the energies above. This is an indication that high energies are harder than expected and require the addition of a new component to the model.\relax }}{25}{figure.caption.15}

The bubbles and the disk are distinct. The SCR template traces the hardening in the data high energy spectrum, thus showing it here. This distribution was expected, in the bubbles because of unpropagated proton CR ejected from the GC, and in the disk because of point sources that are not subtracted.\relax }}{26}{figure.caption.16}

The distribution of molecular clouds as traced by CO can be found in the excess component distribution, whatever hypothesis is used.

DM (middle row) does not fit the disk so well, and the CMZ is not described correctly above 10 GeV.
