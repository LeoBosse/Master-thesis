The energy dispersion is an effect of the uncertainty when measuring a photon's energy. Accounting for it when calculating the instrument response function can be critical at very low energies (around a few hundred MeV), where the statistical uncertainties are not dominant anymore.\relax }}{3}{figure.caption.4}

A linear fit is performed to find the offset at the vertical axis. This number represent the amount the isotropic component shifts the data in all cones. Once this is done for every energy bin, the offset is added to the previous isotropic template and the process is repeated until convergence.\relax }}{7}{figure.caption.8}
