The energy dispersion is the energy resolution of the instrument. This effect is known and can be corrected (in red), lowering the systematic errors. This is what was done here. The black line does not account for energy dispersion. The blue line shows the systematics for specific event types, a kind of analysis that does not make sens for this work. The few percents gained at very low energies (below a few hundred MeV), where the statistical uncertainties are not dominant anymore, can be critical.\relax }}{13}{figure.caption.10}
