\subsection{Discussion on spatial shapes}

Fig. \ref{fig:MCRonly_skymaps} shows the spatial distribution of the flux of each component around 2 GeV, as returned by the fit.

The bremsstrahlung component is consistent with the the expectations. Present everywhere, it is strong in the disk, and decrease a little in the bubbles.

\todo{Though the general shape is spherical, the IC component has an unexpected feature in the form of a strong depletion in the disk, like a "sandwich" structure. This is surprising in the sense that this is where the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and electron density are supposed to be maximal, creating a higher IC flux. A possible explanation could be coming from the dust distribution, screening the starlight component of the ISRF. Thus depriving the ISRF of its main component and leaving only the dust infra red emission and the CMB to interact with the electrons. This could result in a lower IC gamma-ray flux in the disk.}

The SCR component is playing his role, filling the bubbles and the disk, where the high energy portion of the spectra needs a harder spectrum. It traces the sources distribution in the disk and the outflow of high energy protons in the bubbles.

The general shape of PCR looks coherent with he shape of the galaxy, with a strong flux in the bar and the galactic disk in general. When looking closely, one can see the same kind of depletion in the disk than for IC, even if the effect is less remarkable. This finds its cause in the MCR distribution with a very high flux in the disk. The sum of both templates (MCR + PCR) shows no sign of such a feature, which tends to show that some of the PCR photons are absorbed by the MCR template. But the total is coherent, with no unexplainable central gap.

The MCR template also follows the spatial distribution of molecular clouds in our galaxy. It is a good sign since it is supposed to come from those regions.
It is not spherical at all. That could have happened if the excess component has a DM origin, since it is supposed to be spherically distributed.


\subsection{Discussion on the spatial distributions of the other components.}

The spatial distribution of a component can teach a lot about the fit. Every component is closely linked to a known physical process taking place in a known galaxy. The exact details of every cone can not be predicted, but the general shape can. This way, it is possible t verify the goodness of the fit by comparing the fitted spatial distribution of the different templates and the predicted one.
For example, the distribution of the ISRF is expected to be spherical around the GC in the UV range, where most of the starlight is emitted. It can also follow the dust distribution in the disk in the infra-red range. This can be used to check if the IC component is coherent in the fit. Hopefully, the results show a spherical IC component centered on the GC.
The different distribution of each component will be discussed in the following section.

\subsubsection{PCR flux distribution}
The PCR component is produced by diffuse CR protons which react to form a pion which in turn decays into two photons. So the PCR flux is directly proportional to the diffuse CR, the gas and the dust density along the line of sight in the galaxy. So it is expected to present in every direction, with a stronger flux in the disc, and less at high latitudes. The bubbles have a harder CR proton spectrum, that is different from the CR proton forming the PCR template, so it should not be too much present, with SCR instead.

\end{figure}



\subsubsection{IC flux distribution}
The inverse compton component is directly proportional to the ISRF and the electrons CR. Electrons are present everywhere in the galaxy, and the ISRF is dominant in the GC for the UV range, but follows the dust in the IR range and is isotropic in the radio range. This distribution should be visible in the IC component of the fit. Indeed, a spherical distribution can clearly be identified for the three different fits with DM, MCR and MSP.
Nonetheless, there is a noticeable difference int he disk between the IC distribution for the MCR fit and the DM and MSP fits. In the MCR fit, the disk presents a high IC flux when DM and MSP do not. On the contrary, the MSP and DM fit present a clear dip in the galactic disk. This gap is unexpected, since the ISRF is supposed to be the strongest in the disk, and the diffuse electrons are also produced mainly here. \todo{explain this}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{BR flux distribution}
The BR component is linked to the CR electron density along the line of sight and the electromagnetic fields in the galaxy. It should then be present everywhere. It is mainly what can be observed here, but some features are remarkable. Mainly the decrease in flux in the disk and the bubbles.
Depending on the fit, the average flux is also changing. The BR component is a lot more present with the MCR fit than with DM, which in turn presents more BR than the MSP fit. The fact that the MSP fit does not use a lot of BR is consistent with the fact that the MSP spectrum is very soft at low energies. Since BR is also dominant at these energies, both can not have a high flux at the same time. The fit must do concession in order to use them both.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{SCR flux distribution}
The SCR distribution is expected to follow the disc, where point sources can still remains, and the bubbles, where the proton CR spectra is harder. And indeed, the spatial distribution obtained in the three  different fits are similar and correspond perfectly to the expectations.

\section{Adding the MBR component}

\subsection{MBR fixed to MCR, magnetic cut-off}
\todo{add pictutures of graph and skymaps}

The theory behind the MCR component involves a magnetic cut-off for low rigidity CR protons, that changes the gamma-ray spectrum at low energies. Such a cut-off only depends on the rigidity of the CR and the intensity of the electromagnetic field. So there is no reason for it to be only applied to protons, and not to electrons. This is the reasoning that led to introducing a new template, called MBR in the fit, equivalent to the BR template, but calculated from a different electron CR spectra. This new CR spectra present two parts, with two different power laws for high or low energies. It has the exact same spectral indexes than the spectrum for IC and BR, but the break is moved up between 6 and 14 GeV. Then, the break is taken to have the same value than the MCR brake. This way, the magnetic cut-off is applied the same way to the electrons and protons CR. Once again, this component is expected to follow the MCs distribution, or at least to be only present in the disk.

A MIC component was tested as well, but it was not kept for physical reasons. First, the ISRF is not dependent of the electromagnetic field, photons do not carry any electric charge. It is also present in MC, where stars are formed and evolve.

\section{Add DM late}

\todo{difference with DM+MCR. Results and discussion.}

Now the results are clear. MCR is a good solution to the gamma-ray GeV excess in the GC, and could replace the first hypothesis of the DM halo or hidden MSPs. Yet, the DM theory is strongly supported by other measurements \todo{cite}, for example the rotation curves of galaxies, and is one of the most important question of modern physics. And the fact that it is not the primary cause of the effect observed here does not mean it does not exist. On the contrary, under the hypothesis that MCR is really the cause of the excess, the fit could put strong limits on the DM models.

This section will present a few ways to study the current DM WIMP model using the fit method of this thesis.

\subsection{DM and MCR}

\todo{add figure}
A first idea is to let the fit choose for every cone the template that offers the best $\chi^2$ value. Taking a 52.3 GeV WIMP mass and the MCR template with free breaks, the fit has the choice between the two. The results are without much surprise in favor of MCR. Indeed, the previous comparisons of the $\chi^2$ distribution for a MCR or a DM fit showed a clear preference toward MCR. The $\chi^2$ map of a MCR fit is flat around one, even in the disk, whereas a DM fit does not work well for small latitudes. It is then only expected that the fit chooses MCR when it has the choice.

\subsection{DMlate}

This method can not say much else than what was already showed in the previous sections. The second idea that comes to mind is to take the MCR template for granted, and see if their is space to add DM contribution at the end of the fit. In other words, a first fit is performed with the classical templates (PCR, IC, BR), the source (SCR) and the MCR templates. Once the best relative contributions are found, the fit tries to add a DM template to improve the $\chi^2$.
Following the Ockham's razor principle, the least amount of contributions are accepted as true, and any additional component must be treated carefully. This way, the necessity of a DM template is checked, and it contribution can not be mistaken for a classical one.
\todo{add pic}
Such a fit was performed and the results will be discussed in this section. First of all, the DM flux distribution  is very sparse and degrees of magnitude below the other components. This was expected since the $\chi^2$ of the MCR only fit was already good. Only very small changes could improve it without changing the classical contributions. Using the same CMZ region in the GC, the optimal mass was determined to be \todo{mass DM late}.

Further studies of this kind could help to determine limits on the DM particle mass and cross-section.
