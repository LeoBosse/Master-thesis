%% ==================
%This chapter is dedicated to a discussion of the results obtained in the previous Chapter \ref{ch:results}.
%
%Discussions what do they mean?:
%	-Comparison of all 3 templates -> best is MCR from the chi2 maps
%		-Comparison MCR vs DM
%		-Comparison MCR vs MSP
%		-Weniger plots
%		-Specklings
%	
%	-Interpretation of spatial shapes
%		-Expected features
%			-PCR			
%			-IC spherical
%			-BR a little everywhere, less in bubbles			
%			-SCR in disk + bubbles
%		-Sandwich in IC and PCR
%			-MCR replaces PCR -> There is more MCs in disk. Blocks PCR
%			-IC in disk mostly due to Dust and starlight is blocked by it. Dust is only a small portion compared to starlight -> decrease
%		
%		-Shape of the excess component		
%			-Shape of MCR, DM, MSP -> traces the CO map
%			-Only make sense with MCR
%			-DM and MSP have no reason to do that
%
%	
%	-Why is MCR better than DM or MSP
%		-spectral shape of DM
%			-falls off too steep
%		-spectral shape of MSP
%			-Is too soft at low energies
