  abstract={We model the transport of cosmic ray nuclei in the galaxy by means of a new numerical code. At variance with previous numerical models, ours accounts for a generic spatial distribution of the diffusion coefficient. We found that in the case of radially uniform diffusion, the main secondary/primary ratios (B/C, N/O and sub-Fe/Fe) and the modulated antiproton spectrum consistently match the available observations. Convection and re-acceleration do not seem to be required in the energy range that we consider: 1≤ E ≤10 3 GeV/nucleon. We generalize these results, accounting for radial dependence of the diffusion coefficient, which is assumed to trace that of the cosmic ray sources. While this does not affect the prediction of secondary/primary ratios, the simulated longitude profile of the diffuse γ-ray emission is significantly different from that for the uniform case and may agree with EGRET measurements without requiring invoking ad hoc assumptions on the galactic gas density distribution.}

  abstract={The possible gamma-ray excess in the inner Galaxy and the Galactic center (GC) suggested by Fermi -LAT observations has triggered a large number of studies. It has been interpreted as a variety of different phenomena such as a signal from WIMP dark matter annihilation, gamma-ray emission from a population of millisecond pulsars, or emission from cosmic rays injected in a sequence of burst-like events or continuously at the GC. We present the first comprehensive study of model systematics coming from the Galactic diffuse emission in the inner part of our Galaxy and their impact on the inferred properties of the excess emission at Galactic latitudes 2° < |b| < 20° and 300 MeV to 500 GeV. We study both theoretical and empirical model systematics, which we deduce from a large range of Galactic diffuse emission models and a principal component analysis of residuals in numerous test regions along the Galactic plane. We show that the hypothesis of an extended spherical excess emission with a uniform energy spectrum is compatible with the Fermi -LAT data in our region of interest at 95% CL. Assuming that this excess is the extended counterpart of the one seen in the inner few degrees of the Galaxy, we derive a lower limit of 10.0° (95% CL) on its extension away from the GC. We show that, in light of the large correlated uncertainties that affect the subtraction of the Galactic diffuse emission in the relevant regions, the energy spectrum of the excess is equally compatible with both a simple broken power-law of break energy E break  = 2.1 ± 0.2 GeV, and with spectra predicted by the self-annihilation of dark matter, implying in the case of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/barb.gif] {bar b} b final states a dark matter mass of m χ =49 +6.4 −5.4 GeV.}

  abstract={The Large Area Telescope ( Fermi /LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope ( Fermi ) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view (FoV), high-energy γ-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 × 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 ( x , y ) tracking planes, including two layers ( x and y ) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high- Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large FoV (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy γ-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0.3-2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic γ-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter.}

  abstract={We use high-resolution N -body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.}

  abstract={One prediction of particle acceleration in the supernova (SN) remnants in the magnetic wind of exploding Wolf-Rayet and red supergiant stars is that the final spectrum is a composition of a spectrum E –7/3 and a polar cap component of E –2 at the source. This polar cap component contributes to the total energy content with only a few percent, but dominates the spectrum at higher energy. The sum of both components gives spectra which curve upward. The upturn was predicted to occur always at the same rigidity. An additional component of cosmic rays from acceleration by SNe exploding into the interstellar medium adds another component for hydrogen and for helium. After transport, the predicted spectra J ( E ) for the wind-SN cosmic rays are E –8/3 and E –7/3 ; the sum leads to an upturn from the steeper spectrum. An upturn has now been seen by the CREAM mission. Here, we test the observations against the predictions and show that the observed properties are consistent with the predictions. Hydrogen can be shown to also have a noticeable wind-SN component. The observation of the upturn in the heavy element spectra being compatible with the same rigidity for all heavy elements supports the magneto-rotational mechanism for these SNe. This interpretation predicts the observed upturn to continue to curve upward and approach the E –7/3 spectrum. If confirmed, this would strengthen the case that SNe of very massive stars with magnetic winds are important sources of Galactic cosmic rays.}

  abstract={Diffusive shock acceleration at the outer front of expanding supernova remnants has provided by far the most popular model for the origin of galactic cosmic rays, and has been the subject of intensive theoretical investigation. But several problems loomed at high energies—how to explain the smooth continuation of the cosmic-ray spectrum far beyond 10 14 eV, the very low level of TeV gamma-ray emission from several supernova remnants, and the very low anisotropy of cosmic rays (seeming to conflict with the short trapping times needed to convert a E −2 source spectrum into the observed E −2.7 spectrum of cosmic rays). However, recent work on the cosmic ray spectrum (especially at KASCADE) strongly indicates that about half of the flux does turn down rather sharply near 3 × 10 15 V rigidity, with a distinct tail extending to just beyond 10 17 V rigidity; whilst a plausible description (Bell and Lucek) of the level of self-generated magnetic fields at the shock fronts of young supernova remnants implies that many SNRs in varying environments might very well generate spectra extending smoothly to just this 'knee' position, and a portion of the exploding red supergiants could extend the spectrum approximately as needed. At low energies, recent progress in relating cosmic ray compositional details to modified shock structure also adds weight to the belief that the model is working on the right lines, converting energy into cosmic rays very efficiently where injection can occur. The low level of TeV gamma-ray flux from many young SNRs is a serious challenge, though it may relate to variations in particle injection efficiency with time. The clear detection of TeV gamma rays from SNRs has now just begun, and predictions of a characteristic curved particle spectrum give a target for new tests by TeV observations. However, the isotropy seriously challenges the assumed cosmic-ray trapping time and hence the shape of the spectrum of particles released from SNRs. There is otherwise enough convergence of model and observation to encourage belief that the outline of the model is right, but there remains the possibility that the spectral shape of particles actually released is not as previously predicted.}

  abstract={The question of the nature of the dark matter in the Universe remains one of the most outstanding unsolved problems in basic science. One of the best motivated particle physics candidates is the lightest supersymmetric particle, assumed to be the lightest neutralino—a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the photon, the Z boson and neutral scalar Higgs particles. Here we describe DarkSUSY, a publicly available advanced numerical package for neutralino dark matter calculations. In DarkSUSY one can compute the neutralino density in the Universe today using precision methods which include resonances, pair production thresholds and coannihilations. Masses and mixings of supersymmetric particles can be computed within DarkSUSY or with the help of external programs such as FeynHiggs, ISASUGRA and SUSPECT. Accelerator bounds can be checked to identify viable dark matter candidates. DarkSUSY also computes a large variety of astrophysical signals from neutralino dark matter, such as direct detection in low-background counting experiments and indirect detection through antiprotons, antideuterons, gamma-rays and positrons from the galactic halo or high-energy neutrinos from the centre of the Earth or of the Sun. Here we describe the physics behind the package. A detailed manual will be provided with the computer package.}

  abstract={A new, much-improved model of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) is presented. We use the WMAP 7 Galactic synchrotron emission map and more than 40,000 extragalactic rotation measures to constrain the parameters of the GMF model, which is substantially generalized compared with earlier work to now include an out-of-plane component (as suggested by observations of external galaxies) and striated-random fields (motivated by theoretical considerations). The new model provides a greatly improved fit to observations. Consistent with our earlier analyses, the best-fit model has a disk field and an extended halo field. Our new analysis reveals the presence of a large, out-of-plane component of the GMF; as a result, the polarized synchrotron emission of our Galaxy seen by an edge-on observer is predicted to look intriguingly similar to what has been observed in external edge-on galaxies. We find evidence that the cosmic-ray electron density is significantly larger than given by GALPROP or else that there is a widespread striated component to the GMF.}
